 the service from asian paints suffers from poor outside vendors. The workmanship poor and pace of work is very slow. Work at my home which was to be completed in June end is now expected by Aug end. Folks at Asian are good but the outsourced vendors are poor. Help !

Note: This is the closest shade match and there could be a 10-20% shade difference in the real shade and its digital preview. Colours may appear different, due to lighting and screen resolution.
